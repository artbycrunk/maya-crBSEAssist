A useful little script for showing the index of blendshapes. 

**USAGE** :

* Just Source this script, it should open the Blendshape Editor.

* All Blendshape weight will be prefixed with thier index numbers.

* This is useful when adding inbetween targets and you need to specify target index.

* It also increases the text Label size, for reading large blendshape names.
